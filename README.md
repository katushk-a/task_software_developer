- In this task the form was created, where the User can add or remove fields at will. (The fields to be added or deleted have to be of just 2 types â€“ text & select).
- When Adding new fields the User can choose the name for new field, and write various options (for select type).
- The User can delete any field, and also he can cancel the process of creating the new field.
- When the form is submitted, the table is generated, and the User can submit the form as many times as he wants (without changing the structure of the form), and the data will be automatically added to the table. If the User wants to change the structure of the form, he needs to reload the page, because the table was already generated for the previous structure.
- I also added the simple style, so that the page looks a bit better.
